# neural-network-perceptron-in-python

This project shows building and training artificial neural network in Python for regression and classification tasks. 
Solution are created from scratch and without using dedicated higher level libraries.

The goal of this project is to show what computations are needed and how to perform them in order to create artificial neural network perceptron.
Because of this detailed implementation notebooks present how AI models work on a very basic level.
